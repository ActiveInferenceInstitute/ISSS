# Document Processing Pipeline Overview

This initiative offers a robust pipeline designed for the efficient handling of documents sourced from designated websites. It incorporates asynchronous programming to streamline the downloading process and utilizes a variety of processing methodologies for in-depth document analysis.

## Pipeline Components

- **Web Scraper**: Identifies and collects document URLs from targeted websites.
- **Document Downloader**: Facilitates the asynchronous downloading of documents from the URLs obtained.
- **Metadata Archiver**: Stores metadata for each downloaded document, ensuring easy retrieval for future use.
- **File Converter**: Transforms downloaded documents into a uniform format, readying them for analysis.
- **OCR Processor**: Applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to extract text from documents.
- **Figure Extractor**: Isolates figures and their captions from documents for separate analysis.
- **Language Analyzer**: Conducts a thorough examination of the text to identify linguistic patterns and compile statistics.

## Getting Started

1. **Initial Setup**: Install all necessary dependencies by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Configuration**: Adjust settings in `main.py`, including `base_url`, `download_path`, and other paths critical to the document processing workflow.
3. **Run the Pipeline**: Initiate the document processing sequence with `python main.py`.

## Prerequisites

The pipeline depends on the following libraries:
- aiohttp
- asyncio
- BeautifulSoup4
- requests
- OCR libraries (e.g., pytesseract)
- Additional libraries may be required for document conversion and analysis tasks.

## How to Contribute

We encourage contributions that enhance the functionality of the pipeline. To contribute, please adhere to the conventional fork-and-pull request protocol.
